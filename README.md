# AI & ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of my AI and ML projects that I have completed during my studies. Each project is represented by an IPython Notebook file (.ipynb), showcasing different techniques and algorithms.

## Project 1 : Supervised Learning

The "Supervised Learning Project" demonstrates my skills in applying supervised learning algorithms to solve a specific problem. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.

DOMAIN: Medical

<u>CONTEXT</u>: Develop an AI/ML model for medical research to predict patient conditions based on biomechanics features without revealing patient details due to confidentiality.

<u>DATA DESCRIPTION</u>: Biomechanics features of patients are represented by six attributes, including pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic incidence, pelvic radius, and spondylolisthesis degree.

<u>PROJECT OBJECTIVE</u>: Train Supervised Learning algorithms to predict patient conditions using the provided biomechanics data.

**Technologies & Tools Used:**
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter-tuning
- Grid search
- Randomized Search CV
- KNN

<h2 align="center"><strong>Part - B</strong></h2>

<u>DOMAIN</u>: Banking, Marketing

<u>CONTEXT</u>: Implement Machine Learning to improve marketing campaigns in a growing bank by predicting potential customers who will convert based on historical data.

<u>DATA DESCRIPTION</u>: The dataset includes customer attributes like age, customer since, highest spend, zip code, hidden score, monthly average spend, level, mortgage, security, fixed deposit account, internet banking, credit card, and loan on a card.

<u>PROJECT OBJECTIVE</u>: Build an ML model for targeted marketing to increase conversion ratio and expand the borrower base with the same budget.

**Technologies & Tools Used:**
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter-tuning
- Grid search
- Randomized Search CV
- KNN
- SVM
- SMOTE

<span style="color:blue">Project 2: Ensemble Techniques</span>

This repository showcases my project on Ensemble Techniques, where I explored various methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Grid Search. The project uses real-world data to predict customer churn behavior in a telecom company, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods in improving machine learning model performance.

**DOMAIN:** Telecommunications.

**CONTEXT:** A telecom company wants to use their historical customer data and leverage machine learning to predict behavior in an attempt to retain customers. The end goal is to develop focused customer retention programs.

**DATA DESCRIPTION:** The dataset is relevant for understanding customer churn behavior and predicting customer churn. Analyzing customer churn is important for businesses to identify factors that contribute to customer attrition and develop strategies to retain customers.
