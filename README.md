# AI & ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of my AI and ML projects that I have completed during my studies. Each project is represented by an IPython Notebook file (.ipynb), showcasing different techniques and algorithms.

## Project 1: Supervised Learning Project

The "Supervised Learning Project" demonstrates my skills in applying supervised learning algorithms to solve a specific problem. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.
