# AI & ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of my AI and ML projects that I have completed during my studies. Each project is represented by an IPython Notebook file (.ipynb), showcasing different techniques and algorithms.

## Project 1: Supervised Learning 

The "Supervised Learning Project" demonstrates my skills in applying supervised learning algorithms to solve a specific problem. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.

## Project 2: Ensemble Techniques 

This repository showcases my project on Ensemble Techniques, where I explored various methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Grid Search. The project uses real-world data to predict customer churn behavior in a telecom company, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods in improving machine learning model performance.

### Results-

- The project achieved promising results in predicting customer churn using ensemble methods.
- Key metrics and visualizations showcase model performance.
